Introduction:

This project is based on pizza sales data collected throughout the year 2015. The dataset includes detailed information on pizza orders, such as order date, pizza type, size, quantity sold, and revenue generated.

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, SQL queries were used for data validation and cleaning. These queries helped in:

Identifying and handling missing or duplicate entries
Standardizing pizza names and categories
Aggregating order and revenue data by time, category, and size

After thorough data validation, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize key business metrics and uncover sales insights. The dashboard includes:

Total revenue, order volume, and average order value
Sales trends by hour, day, and week
Best and worst-performing pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders
Category-wise and size-wise sales distribution
